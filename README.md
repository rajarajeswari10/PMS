# ParkingManagementSystem
Parking Management System is an application which usually helps in generating the automated bills to the vehicles based on the duration the vehicle have been parked. 
If the user gives the details of his/her name, vehicle number, entry time, exit time, by this info we will calculate the parking fee and display the details of vehicle and display the parking fee to be paid. 
And all the details will be stored in files. we can see the details of the vehicle anytime.
